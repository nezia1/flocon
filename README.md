My NixOS configurations, using flakes.

# üõ†Ô∏è Structure

| Name                | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [assets](assets/)   | Resources used throughout the system (images etc.)             |
| [config](config/)   | NixOS configuration                                            |
| [hosts](hosts/)     | Host-specific                                                  |
| [lib](lib/)         | Internal library functions / helpers                           |
| [modules](modules/) | Internal and shared modules, used throughout [config](config/) |
| [parts](parts/)     | Modularized flake outputs, powered by flake-parts              |

My configuration is structured based on the following principles:

1. Hosts should be the main entry points and outputs.
1. Abstractions should be avoided as much as possible.
1. Setting up theming should be as simple as changing one or two options.

The main configuration can be found in [modules](modules/), which declares most
of my programs and services.

My hosts can then pick and choose the programs and configurations that they need
from the local module system, which have its options declared in
[modules/options](modules/options/) for easy reference.

# üë• Credits

People / repositories I have copied / learned from:

- [fufexan/dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) for the configuration
  structure
- [jacekpoz/nixos](https://git.jacekpoz.pl/poz/niksos) for learning how NixOS
  modules work
- [sodiboo](https://github.com/sodiboo) for helping me a whole lot with
  Niri-specific issues
- [llakala](https://github.com/llakala) for being very thorough and helpful when
  cleaning up my code and general structure.
- [Lunarnovaa](https://github.com/Lunarnovaa) for her
  [hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem) configuration and functions, that I
  used when switching away from home-manager, and for being a great person.
- [NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf) for providing a comprehensive
  archive repo, [nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx) who helped me transition
  to flake-parts.

Some bits have also been borrowed from within the configuration, and credit has
been given where its due.
